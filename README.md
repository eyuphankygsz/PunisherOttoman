# PunisherOttoman
Preview of the game:
You are a Sultan(King of the Ottoman Empire) and everyone is coming to you and talk to you about their problems and requests.

As a Sultan, you have to make some choices. You can either apply or deny their requests, or you can go further and execute the person who come to you about the request.

Every choice you make affects both palace happiness, folk(nation) happiness, personal happiness and fear. Don't worry if you run out of theese bars. Because game does not end by the bars.

Also some folks may give you items if you apply, deny or execute them. So be careful while reading the requests.

The game I coded in 2 days for an Ottoman themed Game-Jam.

You can download project files or download executable file in the releases.
